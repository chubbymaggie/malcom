# IP Geolocation

For IP geolocation to work, you need to download the [Maxmind](http://dev.maxmind.com/) database and copy the .dat file to this directory.
You can get Maxmind's free (and thus more or less accurate) database from the following link: http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/
Malcom will look for a GeoIP2-City.mmdb file. The filename and path will be customizable in future versions.

## Why not include the file here?
Due to licensing issues, and also to make the Git package smaller. Thanks to [WalterDalton](https://github.com/WalterDalton) for the tip.
